You have many options for creating infrastructure in GCP.

Google Cloud Console
The gcloud command-line tool, possibly automated in a bash script:

---- in Cloudshell

---- on a computer

---- from a security account authorized VM

A program that calls the cloud RESTful API using any of the client libraries
Deployment Manager
Console can interrogate your running environment and customize menus so that you are not faced with the problem of possibly configuring invalid options. And console can perform compound actions that coordinate multiple API calls.

Script and program automation makes infrastructure that is maintainable and documented. And once you create a script that you like, you can reuse it or modify it to make you more productive.
