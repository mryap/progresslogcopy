Using Deployment Manager templates, including JINJA2 templates, you created a virtual machine that loads a python application and dependencies and boots up and configures itself to run a service.

- Develop a service using a pre-written Python application called "Echo" and example Deployment Manager templates written in YAML and JINJA2.
- Create a deployment package suitable for Deployment Manager using the python package manager, pip.
- Stage your package in a Cloud Storage bucket.
- Manually test the application to ensure that it is working properly.
- Use Deployment Manager to deploy the Echo service.
- Test the new service.
