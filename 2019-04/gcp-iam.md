Policies are a union of those applied on resource itself and those inherited from higher levels in the hierarchy. If a parent policy is less restrictive, it overrides a more restrictive policy applied on the resource. If a parent policy is more restrictive, it does not override a less restrictive policy applied on the resource. Therefore, access granted at a higher level in the hierarchy cannot be taken away by policies applied at a lower level in the hierarchy.
