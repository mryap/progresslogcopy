- ACL: Access control list
- Set an ACL for private, and modify to public
- Lifecycle management
- Set policy to delete objects after 31 days
- Versioning
- Create a version and restore a previous version
- Directory synchronization
- Recursively synchronize a VM directory with a bucket
- Cross-project resource sharing using IAM
