### To Find Out More

If you are using Github to host your website, your code repositories (repo) need to be public. At the same time, you want to maintain a private repo where your team can collaborate and track development issues. This could be a solution. Upload your new content to private repo then duplicate this private repo to a public repo. Downside is that you have two repo to deal with? https://help.github.com/en/articles/duplicating-a-repository


### Learned today

Use `SPLIT()` function to tell BigQuery to break V2Themes field by semicolon and return as multiple records, one per mention.

Why? 
Because [V2Themes column uses nested delimiting](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GDELT-Global_Knowledge_Graph_Codebook-V2.1.pdf) - each mention of a recognized theme in an article is separated by a semicolon, and for each mention, the theme and its character offset within the article are separated by a comma.

The correct code is

~~~
REGEXP_REPLACE(SPLIT(V2Themes,';'), r',.*', "") theme  
~~~
