## Learned today

Use `SPLIT()` function to tell BigQuery to break V2Themes field by semicolon and return as multiple records, one per mention.

Why? 
Because [V2Themes column uses nested delimiting](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GDELT-Global_Knowledge_Graph_Codebook-V2.1.pdf) - each mention of a recognized theme in an article is separated by a semicolon, and for each mention, the theme and its character offset within the article are separated by a comma.
