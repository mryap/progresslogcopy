# Progress Log

## What is this?
A `progresslog` is a log of the tasks I am planning on completing, the tasks I have completed, the problems I faced, the solutions I found and the resources I discovered in the process.

## Why do I log?

I log to keep track of the problems I encounter, so that I can find the solution more quickly. I use it as a way to keep track of the resources I found in a more orderly and context-dependent way than by simply saving it to my bookmarks. I also use it as a notepad, to keep track of what I promised myself I would have a look at later. Finally, I use it as a reflection tool, to appreciate how much I have progressed and improved.

## How do I log?

I use the following template for weekly logs. 

```
# Codelog #X - XXXX-XX-XX
